# Web-Developer-Class
Files from Udemy Web Developer Class
This repo has two purposes
- First, to figure out how to practically set up a development environment using Atom and Git
-- Edit > Save to local repository (becomes unstaged changes) > Staged Changes > Commit > Push (from staging to GIT Repository)
- Second, to store the exercise files from the class at Udemy "The Complete Web Developer"

Good luck to me!
